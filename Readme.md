## User Story
```
AS A USER I want to be able to find all of the events that interest me 
SO THAT I can save them to my profile.
WHEN I open the application,
THEN I am prompted to login or signup or I wonâ€™t be able to search for or see events.
WHEN I have created an account or logged in,
THEN I will be able to search events near me and see my saved events.
WHEN I find an event that I think is interesting,
THEN I have the ability to save an event an all of its corresponding info.
```
